# AmazonPlatformSimulation

This application is designed for a logistics company modeled after Amazon's distribution system. It efficiently manages the tracking of orders from the moment they arrive at local distribution centers—akin to Canada Post or UPS locations—until they are delivered to customers. The application focuses on the segment of the supply chain from distributors to customers, ensuring transparency and real-time updates for each order. Note that the transportation of orders from the central warehouse to the distributors is automated and not tracked within this system.
